Selenium Methods:

    1-Driver methods  WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver()
        *findElement
        *findElements
        *navigate.to/back/refresh/forward
        *getCurrentUrl
        *GetPageSource
        *GetTitle
        *Get
        *manage.windows.maximize
        *manage.windows.minimize
        *.close
        *quit
    2-WebElement methods
        *Click
        *SendKeys
        *Attribute
        *submit
        *isDisplayed
        *isSelected
        *getText
        *isEnabled
    3)What is the difference between driver.findElement and driver.findElements():
        *)find element focuses on single element
        *)When it fails, it throws an exception(NoSuchElement Exception)
        *)it returns webElement
        Find elements: *it focuses on the multiple elements
                        *when it fails, it doesn't throw any exception,it returns List of empty box
                        *it returns List<webelement>
    4)LOCATORS:
     *Id
     *Class
     *Name
     *ClassName
     *TagName
     *Xpath
     *CSS
     *LinkText
     *partialLinkText
     5)COMMON WAYS OF FINDING THE ELEMENTS:
        *XPATH: //TagName[@Attribute='Attribute Value'];
        *Contains: //TagName[containts(text(),'textvalue')]
        *Exact Text: //Tagname[.='exact text']
        *Parent-child;//h3/p
        *Absoulute XPATH: /html/body/div[2]/a/p
    6)What is the difference between ABSOLUTE and RELATIVE XPATH:
        ABS:*single slash and focus on the top parent-to chil
        REL: *double slash and focus on the child. -->this is more efficient
    7)TesTNG:
    *How do you order your methods in your framework with TestNG?
    *I am using priority key word.
        validation for our test cases in a good format.
        *You can have multiple @Test annotations in same class.(you can do multiple validation)
    8)Assert.assertEqual(actual, expected)--> validation
    9)WHEN YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH YOUR TEST WHAT SHOULD I DO ?
    *)STEP 1: I ALWAYS CHECK THE EXCEPTION TYPE THAT I HAVE(SCROOL UP YOUR CONSOLE AND LOOK FOR THE EXCEPTION KEY WORD)
    *STEP 2: AFTER YOU KNOW YOUR EXCEPTION TYPE, GO AND FIND THE LINE OF PROBLEM BY CLICKING THE  BLUE NUMBER ON THE CONSOLE.
        IF THE EXCEPTION IS NOSUCHELEMENTEXCEPTION:{
        STEP3:CHECK YOUR PATH.(COPY IT AND PASTE IT ON THE WEBSITE THAT YOU INSPECTED)

             IF IT IS STILL UNIQUE{
                STEP4:GO AND MAXIMIZE YOUR SCREEN WITH driver.manage.window.maximize
                    IF IT IS STILL NOT WORKING{
                    STEP5:USE THREAD.SLEEP.(BEFORE AND AFTER THE FAILING ACTION)
                    }
              }
         IF THE EXCEPTION IS STALEREFERENCEEXCEPTION{
            STEP 4: REFRESH THE PAGE with driver.navigate.refresh
            STEP 5:REINITILIAZE YOUR WEBELEMENT.
         }
        }
        IF THE EXCEPTION IS ELEMENTISNOTINTERACTABLE EXCEPTION{
            STEP4:PUT THREAD.SLEEP BEFORE AND AFTER YOU CLICK
            STEP5:MAKE SURE THE ELEMENT HAS 'a' TAG.
        }
    HOMEWORK: GO TO THE OPTIONS, TEST THE SORT BUTTON FUNCTIONS:
    1)ONCE YOU CLICK IT SHOULD BE ASCENDING ORDER
    2)SECOND TIME CLICK IT SHOULD BE DESCENDING ORDER
