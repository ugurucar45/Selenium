OBJECTIVES FOR TODAY:
 *Students will be able to learn
    -the history/improvement of Selenium
    -types of selenium
    -how to create a selenium project
    -identify the terms MAVEN,POM...
    -how to implement codes for selenium.
SELENIUM : WHAT IS SELENIUM:
Selenium is an automation tool. It automates only web application(facebook,amazon,ebay....)--> anything that runs through web browsers(chrome, firefox,Microsoft Edge, Safari etc...)
INTERVIEW QUESTION:WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF THE SELENIUM?
SELENIUM DISADVANTAGES:(LIMITATION)
1)Selenium cannot automate the captcha(if we cannot automate the captcha then how are we going to create our automation --> Dev Env- QA- Stage- Production.During QA environment they will disable the captcha for your automation)
2)Selenium cannot automate the pictures(Applitools can automate the picture)
3)Selenium has no call center
4)Selenium has no reporting system(TESTNG,CUCUMBER HTML REPORT)
5)Selenium automates only web application not mobile, desktop application.
SELENIUM ADVANTAGES:
1)Selenium is free and open source tool(there is no company constantly(periodically) improving the application.Community(everyone) is contributing))
2)Selenium supports multiple browsers(Chrome,Safari...)
3)Selenium supports multiple coding language.(java,Ruby,C#,Phyton,javascript)
INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:CAN YOU TALK LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TYPES OF SELENIUM AND WHY SPECIFICALLY YOU CHOOSE [your answer should selenium webdriver]?
1-Selenium RC(Remote Control):The application is stored in the server and automation is happening in the erver.(it is not used anymore)-->merged with selenium webdriver to selenium 2;
2-Selenium IDE(Integrated Development Environment): is primarily record/run tool.
The reason I am not using IDE anymore because it is not reliable, and also it doesn't wait my elements from website to be loaded.
3-Selenium WebDriver: it is a library that we can add to our project(java project) and start using the ready class.
4-Selenium Grid:it will help us to run our automation script(project) in different server.
    10000-->60-80 hours. in different web browser 4 -->180-240
    This is also called paralell testing.
    15 hours will take to finish.

    WHAT IS MAVEN AND POM ?
    HOW TO CREATE A SELENIUM PROJECT:
    STEP1:Open intelliJ and click File-->New -->Project
    STEP2:pick MAVEN from the list(on the left) and Click Next then GIve a proper name for the projectname then click finish.
    STEP3:Delete the test folder since it is for unit testing.
     WHAT IS MAVEN: Maven is a tool which is used for building and managing java based project.
     *in Maven, a dependecy is just another archive(java,zip and so on) which our current project needs in order to compile,build,test,and run..
     **If these  dependencies are not present in the local repository, then Maven will download them from a remote repository for your local machine.
     POM:(Project Object Model):
     every dependency(librar, tools will go under the pom.xml file.)
    STEP4:Add selenium to the project.--> Create a dependencies under pom.xml file--> Go to the MVNrepository website for the dependency-->Find the Selenium 4.0.0 and click or copy all the dependencies from the box.-->go to your intelliJ and paste this under <dependencies which we created.-->Click the m sign top right.
    STEP5:If you do not have google chrome go and type google chrome download on the google. and install it.(for people who don't have google chrome)
    STEP6:Selenium is a driver of the car but we need a key to start the engine.Key will be our CHROME.exe or other keys like geckodriver(firefox);
    Interview Questions: DO you know the the driver for Firefox ?
                         What do you use as a driver for Google Chrome?
    Step7:Search for the "dowload chrome.exe for selenium"--> Download the chrome.exe after you check the version of the chrome.--> and download the proper one.
    Step8: Once you download the chrome.exe then copy->paste under the Project(seleniumB11 mine).
    RECAP:
    -We learned the history of the SELENIUM;
    -We learned how to setup selenium to our computer
    -We learned the terminology of selenium (like maven, pom, dependency)
    -We learned how to use methods of driver.(get, navigate to, back,forward, close, getpagesource,gettitle, quit, getcurrenturl)
    INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:
    1-What is the difference between driver.get() - driver.navigate.to():
        *To be honest there is not really much difference between them.But i think these 2 differences are major:
        - First difference is I would definetely say LOADING time for the element. Driver.get() method waits all elements to be loaded.Unlike driver.get(), driver.navigate to doesn't wait for all elements to be loaded.
        -Second difference is driver.navigate has methods(like forward, back,refresh,to)
     2)What is the difference between driver.quit() -driver.close();
        *In my project I generally use DRIVER.QUIT()to make sure I close all the tabs after the automation.(it closes all the tabs)
        *driver.close()-->it closes the CURRENT PAGE(tab).
     RECAP:
     1)Setup
     2)pom.xml --> stores the dependency
     3)mvn repository-->it is a place that contains all the repositories
     4)chrome.exe --> because it is a key for the car. without this chrome will
     not launch.
        firefox-->gechodriver.exe--> this is for firefox
     5)System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver","chromedriver")
        WebDriver driver= new ChromeDriver(); (good)
        ChromeDriver driver =new ChromeDriver(): (good)
        WebDriver driver = new WebDriver();-->it is not possible
     6)Driver Methods:
        -driver.get()-->it navigates to the website.but it waits for the all elements to be loaded
        -driver.navigate --> to, forward, back, refresh --> it doesn't wait for the all elements to be loaded and it has methods(difference between get and navigate()))
        -driver.getCurrentUrl-->it returns String and gives you the url of the page.
        -driver.getTitle()-->it returnts String and gives you the title of the page
        -driver.GetPageSource-->it returns the string and gives you the html of the page
        -driver.manage.window.maximize()-->it maximizes your page.
        -driver.findElement();
        LOCATORS:
        We have 8 types of locators:
        1)ID-->it gives you more accurate location.(id="techtorial1");
        2)ClassName
        3)Name
        4)TagName
        5)LinkText
        6)PartialLinkText
        7)XPATH
        8)CSS
    NOTE:The purpose of the locators it to find the unique element and manipulate the data(change).
    NOTE:If you provide wrong path for the webelement.It will throw an exception which is called "NoSuchElementException"
    INTERVIEW QUESTION:What is StaleelementReference exception and in what condition do you get it. How do you handle it ?
    NOTE:StaleElementReferenceException:we can get stalereferenceexception when the element was on the page buy my driver is not able to see the element anymore.
        1-The element values is updated(like attribute)
            button id ="tec2" when you click this button it updates id (dynamic)
            Webelement button  =driver.findElement(By.id="tec2");
            button.click();
            id="tec3"
        2-The page is refreshed.
        3-After navigating to the other page, if you come back to original and use the same element that you stored before(like java) it will throw this exception.
    HOW Can you handle it:
    *you should reinitiliazed the webelement one more time.
NOTE:
    XPATH is the most advance way of finding the elements.
    //TAGNAME[@AttributeName='AttributeValue'];
    WE have 2 types of XPATH:
     first type: Absolute Xpath:it stars with the single slash(/) and it goes from all the way top to bottom.(/carinventory/car/brand[1])
     ([parent-child relationship])
     /Springfield--> /USA/IL/Chicago/RogesPark[2]
     SECOND TYPE : RELATIVE XPATH:
     Is the most common xpath that people use and there could be parent-child relationship for relative as well but it mostly focuses on the direct child.
       //TAGNAME[@AttributeName='AttributeValue'];
RECAP SELENIUM LOCATORS:
INTERVIEW QUESTIONS: HOW MANY LOCATORS DO YOU HAVE IN SELENIUM WHICH ONE DO YOU USE THE MOST AND WHY ?
1)ID --> ATTRIBUTE IS ID
2)CLASSNAME-->ATTRIBUTE IS CLASS
3)NAME --> ATTRIBUTE IS NAME
4)TAGNAME --> ATTRIBUTE IS TAGNAME (//TAGNAME)
5)LINKTEXT --> ANCHOR(A)
6)PARTIALLINKTEXT (ANCHOR A)
7)XPATH (// SPECIAL SIGN) ____I USE THE XPATH, AND ID THE MOST
8)CSS
INTERVIEW QUESTION 2:
WHAT IS THE TYPE OF XPATH AND WHICH ONE DO YOU USE THE MOST ?
    -ABSOLUTE XPATH; PARENT-CHILD AND SINGLE SLASH(/)
    -RELATIVE XPATH: IT MOSTLY FOCUS ON THE DIRECT CHILD AND DOUBLE SLASH.


WEBELEMENTS METHODS:
    1).click()-->it clicks the <a>tag and button
    2).getText()-->it gets the text of the element
    3).sendKeys()-->it sends the keys to input are(it should typeable)
    4).isSelected()-->it checks that the box is selected or not
    5).isDisplayed()-->it checks thaty the box is there or not(visible);

    driver.findElements--> it finds the element
