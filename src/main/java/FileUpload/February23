RECAP:
Alert is a class to handle the alert/popups
1-Comes from the System--> Operation System popups-->We cannot handle the OS popups with
the selenium.As much as I know from my search there is a robot class that handle OS popups.
2-Comes from HTML-->HTML pop ups--> We can handle this popups by finding the elements and click/close.
3-Comes from JS --> JS pop-ups-->We can handle this popups by using ALERT class.

    -Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert();
        -alert.accept()-->it clicks "OK" button
        -alert.dismiss()-->it clicks "Cancel" button
        -alert.sendKeys()-->it sends the input to the pop-ups
        -alert.getText()-->it gets the text of popups.
INTERVIEW QUESTION:
What is the difference between soft-assert and hard-Assert?
***SOFT ASSERT is really useful when you need to execute all the test cases even though some of them fail.It will not stop your code and throw exceptions.
NOTE:IT must come with SoftAssertAll() at the end,but disadvantage of using soft assert is it will not tell you the exact location(line) that is failing and type of exception.
***HARD Assert will stop when the code is failing and it will not execute the next line of code.The disadvantage of Hard Assert
is you will not be able to complete your all tests cases if there is a failure in your code, but the advantage of using Hard-assert is when your code fails,
it will give you the name of exceptions and location(line) of the code failing.
