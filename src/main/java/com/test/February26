File Upload:
INTERVIEW QUESTION:
1)How do you upload file with selenium?
  - Find the location of ChooseFile button
  -Then you need to send the keys of location of the file you want to upload from your computer.(Mac-->right click and get info copy where parts)
            (Windows-->right click properties and copy location)
  -I need to add the name of file at the end.(like usa.png)
      /Users/techtorial/Desktop/usa.png
  -Then I need to find the location of upload button and then click.
 2)What is the difference between click() and submit()?
    1)Click() method can come from different ways
        -Action class
        -WebElement
        -Java Script
        -Alert class
    2)Click doesn't have any requirement as long as element is clickable.If element is not clickable-->Elementisnotinteractable
    1)Submit() method comes from the only WebElement
    2)Even thought element is not clickable, it will not throw any exception.
    3***)TO BE ABLE TO USE SUBMIT() METHOD, IT MUST BE UNDER THE ***FORM*** TAG. and you should check also the type is button or submit.
    SOFT ASSERT:
    Soft assert is a way to validate the tests.I use the softAssert to make sure all of my test cases are executed even though some of the data is failing.
    *At the end you MUST use ***** ASSERT.ALL*****.
    *You need to create an object for softAssert
            SoftAssert softassert= new SoftAssert
            softassert.true,equal...                                    LEVEL 2

    WELCOME TO THE NEW PROFESSIONAL TESTING WORLD
                                                                         LEVEL 3
    PAGE OBJECT MODEL(WE WILL CREATE OUR FRAMEWORK)
    It is a way to organize all the elements, pages, dependencies, tests...etc
    in your project. Every page elements go to the different classes related with their page name, when we need these elements we call from the page class.
    Using page object will help us to centralize the page element and changing locators for the element will be more easier and organized.
    ======================================================================
    PAGE OBJECT MODEL FLOW:
    TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A FRAMEWORK WE HAVE TO ORGANIZE OUR PROJECT:
    1-CREATE PAGES CLASSES UNDER PAGES PACKAGES : TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS EACH OF THE ELEMENTS AND METHODS OF THE PAGE.(for reference check the pages classes in your framework)
    2-CREATE TESTS CLASSES UNDER TESTS PACKAGES: TO BE ABLE TO DO YOUR VALIDATION(ASSERTION).TEST CLASS SHOULD HAVE LESS CODE AND IMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION(LIKE ASSERTION)
    3-IF YOU ARE REPEATING SOME PARTS OF YOUR CODE, YOU CAN USE BEFOREMETHOD AND AFTERMETHOD ANNOTATION TO REDUCE AMOUNT OF CODES.
        -WE CREATE TESTBASE CLASS.THIS CLASS SHOULD BE EXTENDED FROM TESTS CLASSES.
